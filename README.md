# NumPy: The Fundamental Package for Scientific Computing in Python

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a powerful library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and a wide range of routines for fast operations on arrays. These operations include mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more.

At the heart of NumPy is the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) object. This encapsulates arrays of homogeneous data types, enabling efficient operations in compiled code for superior performance. NumPy arrays have distinct advantages over standard Python sequences:

- **Fixed Size**: NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike dynamically growing Python lists. Resizing an ndarray creates a new array, improving memory management.
- **Homogeneous Data Type**: All elements in a NumPy array must be of the same data type, resulting in consistent memory usage. This contrasts with Python lists which can contain different data types.
- **Efficiency**: NumPy enables efficient mathematical and data manipulation operations on large datasets. These operations are often faster and require less code compared to native Python sequences.

NumPy's impact extends beyond its core functionality. Many scientific and mathematical Python-based packages utilize NumPy arrays for their efficiency and capabilities. This means that to effectively utilize modern scientific and mathematical software in Python, understanding NumPy arrays is essential.

## Why NumPy is Fast?

NumPy's speed stems from its vectorized operations, which eliminate explicit looping and indexing in favor of optimized pre-compiled C code. Vectorized code offers several benefits:

- **Conciseness**: Vectorized code is more concise and easier to read, leading to fewer bugs.
- **Mathematical Notation**: Code closely resembles standard mathematical notation, making it easier to translate mathematical concepts into code.
- **Pythonic**: Vectorization results in more "Pythonic" code, avoiding inefficient and cumbersome for loops.

NumPy also employs broadcasting, enabling implicit element-by-element operations. This means that most operations, including arithmetic, logical, and functional, naturally behave in an element-wise manner.

## Who Uses NumPy?

NumPy fully supports an object-oriented approach through the `ndarray` class, which offers methods and attributes for versatile array manipulation. Many methods in `ndarray` are mirrored by functions in the outermost NumPy namespace, accommodating different programming paradigms.

NumPy's array dialect and the `ndarray` class have become the de-facto standard for multi-dimensional data interchange in Python. Its flexibility and power have made it an essential tool in the realm of scientific computing.

# NumPy Basics

Welcome to the NumPy Basics repository! This repository provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of NumPy, a powerful Python library for numerical computations involving multi-dimensional arrays or matrices.

## Introduction

NumPy's primary object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It's essentially a table of elements, often numbers, all of the same type, and indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy, these dimensions are referred to as axes.

## Array Basics

For instance, consider an array representing the coordinates of a point in 3D space: `[1, 2, 1]`. This array has one axis, and that axis contains 3 elements, giving it a length of 3. In a more complex example below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, and the second axis has a length of 3.

[[1., 0., 0.],
[0., 1., 2.]]


NumPy provides a class for arrays called `ndarray`, also known by the alias `array`. It's important to note that `numpy.array` is distinct from the Standard Python Library's `array.array`, which handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality.

## Attributes of ndarray

Key attributes of an `ndarray` object include:

- `ndarray.ndim`: The number of axes (dimensions) of the array.
- `ndarray.shape`: The dimensions of the array, expressed as a tuple of integers indicating the size along each dimension. For example, a matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns has a shape of `(n, m)`.
- `ndarray.size`: The total number of elements in the array, calculated as the product of the dimensions specified in the `shape` tuple.
- `ndarray.dtype`: Describes the data type of the elements in the array. You can use standard Python types or specialized NumPy types like `numpy.int32`, `numpy.float64`, etc.
- `ndarray.itemsize`: The size in bytes of each element in the array. For instance, an array of elements of type `float64` has an item size of 8 bytes.
- `ndarray.data`: The buffer containing the actual elements of the array. You'll usually access elements using indexing rather than this attribute.

# An Example

Welcome to the NumPy Example section! In this section, we'll walk through a simple example to demonstrate the usage of NumPy arrays.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D array with values from 0 to 14, reshaped to 3 rows and 5 columns
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)

print("Array a:")
print(a)
# Output:
# array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
#        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
#        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])

print("Shape of a:", a.shape)  # Output: (3, 5)
print("Number of dimensions in a:", a.ndim)  # Output: 2
print("Data type of elements in a:", a.dtype.name)  # Output: 'int64'
print("Size of each element in bytes:", a.itemsize)  # Output: 8
print("Total number of elements in a:", a.size)  # Output: 15
print("Type of array a:", type(a))  # Output: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>

# Create a 1D array using the np.array function
b = np.array([6, 7, 8])

print("\nArray b:")
print(b)
# Output: array([6, 7, 8])

print("Type of array b:", type(b))  # Output: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
